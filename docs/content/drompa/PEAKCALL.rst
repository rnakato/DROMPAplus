Peak-calling
---------------------------------------------

In the **PC_SHARP** and **PC_BROAD** modes, drompa+ can call peaks by supplying the ``--callpeak`` option::

  $ dir=parse2wigdir+
  $ drompa+ PC_SHARP \
           -i $dir/H3K4me3.100.bw,$dir/Input.100.bw,H3K4me3,,,100 \
           -i $dir/H3K27me3.100.bw,$dir/Input.100.bw,H3K27me3,,,10 \
           -i $dir/H3K36me3.100.bw,$dir/Input.100.bw,H3K36me3,,,10 \
           -o drompa4 -g refFlat.txt --gt genometable.txt \
           --lpp 2 --showitag 2 --callpeak

   Highlighting peaks.

Peak regions are highlighted in orange.
The peak list for each sample pair is also outputted as "<output-name>.<label>.peak.tsv"::

   $ ls drompa4.*.tsv
   drompa4.H3K27me3.peak.tsv  drompa4.H3K36me3.peak.tsv  drompa4.H3K4me3.peak.tsv

The peak list is in tab-delimited text format and can be opened in a text editor or Microsoft Excel.
It contains the following columns:

- chromosome name
- start position
- end position
- peak summit (center of summit bin)
- peak width
- ChIP read pileup
- Input read pileup
- ChIP/Input enrichment (pileup)
- P-value (ChIP internal)
- P-value (ChIP/Input enrichment)
- peak name.

.. note::

    - If a BED file is specified using the ``-i`` option, drompa+ does not internally call peaks but highlights the specified regions instead.
    - By default, chromosomes Y and M (Mt) are ignored during analysis. Supply the ``--includeYM`` option to include these chromosomes.
    - When supplying the ``--chr`` option, peaks for only the specified chromosome are called.
    - Supply the ``--offpdf`` option to omit PDF file generation and obtain peak lists only.

Detail of significance test
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The **PC_SHARP** and **PC_BROAD** modes adopt a two-step procedure for the significance testing of peak-calling.

- In the first step, they identify significantly enriched sites compared to a background null model, assuming a Poisson distribution in local background region (100 kbp).
- In the second step, from these candidate sites, they identify significantly enriched ones compared to the input control based on the binomial distribution.

   Schematic representation of the peak-calling thresholds.


Accordingly, there are multiple thresholds for peak-calling, as discussed below:

- Main thresholds:

     - ``--pthre_internal``: the p-value of the first step (ChIP-internal enrichment)
     - ``--pthre_enrich``: the p-value of the second step (ChIP/Input enrichment)

- Optional thresholds:

     - ``--ethre``: the ChIP/Input enrichment
     - ``--ipm``: the normalized intensity (height) of the peak summit

See ``--help`` for the default threshold values for each drompa+ mode.
We recommend using the ``--pthre_enrich`` option as the main threshold for peak-calling.


Peak-calling without the input sample
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If the input sample is not specified, drompa+ calls peaks using the ChIP sample (``--pthre_internal``) and skips the second step (``--pthre_enrich``) of the peak-calling procedure.
However, we strongly recommend that the ChIP sample is compared with the corresponding input data to decrease the number of false positive sites derived from repeated regions.

Peak-calling in **PC_ENRICH** mode
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, the **PC_ENRICH** mode does not implement a significance test but simply calls regions containing ChIP/Input enrichments above the enrichment threshold (``--ethre``, 2.0 by default) and the peak intensity threshold (``--ipm``, 5.0 by default).
